    "Duping mode can be toggled with a $(item)dupe wand/$. It makes it so that the $(l:drawers)drawer@! starts duping items when you extract beyond what it stores. @p@This is useful for server admins that want to give out free items, or as an endgame unlock in a modpack.",
    "Like $(l:lock)locks@! the items aren't consumed and can be applied to access points. @p@Unlike other modifiers this one isn't obtainable in survival mode by default. However, modpacks often add recipes for the dupe wand."
