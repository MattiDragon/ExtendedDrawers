    "Hidden mode can be toggled with a $(item)black dye/$. It makes it so that the $(l:drawers)drawer@! doesn't show it's item'. @p@This is mostly useful when you have a big network of drawers and want to improve performance as rendering the item icons can be very expensive.",
    "Like $(l:lock)locks@! the items aren't consumed and can be applied to access points. @p@Hiding can also applied to $(l:shadow_drawers)shadow drawers@!. This is mostly useful if you want to use one in a contraption."
