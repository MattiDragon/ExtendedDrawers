A mod inspired by storage drawers that aims to allow for easy creation of powerful yet not
overpowered storage using simple components.

## Features
### In-game Guide Book
Crafted by combining a book with and upgrade frame, the guide book will explain in more detail how the mod works.

### Drawers
Drawers are blocks that can store a lot of a few items. They can be interacted with in world or using hopper or pipes from other mods.

### Access Points
Access points are blocks that can interact with multiple drawers that are connected to them. 
They only support insertion in world, but can be extracted from using pipes
and hoppers.

### Shadow Drawers
Shadow drawers show the amount of a resource that is available in the whole network and allows
for insertion and expansion of that resource.

### Upgrades
Upgrades are items that extend the capacity of a drawer slot. 

### Locking
You can use a lock on drawers to make them keep their selected item even when empty.

### Voiding mode
If sneak clicked with a lava bucket, drawers will start voiding excess items

### Hidden mode
Hide icons on drawers to reduce lag or hide your valuables. Remember, anyone can change it.

## Upcoming and Potential Features
Here are some features that are **not** in mod yet. Some may be added others may not. Features 
outside this list could also be added.

* **Compacting drawers**
  * Complicated to implement
  * Open to PRs for them
* **Progress bars**
  * Not sure if there's any use

## Other Info
### Modpack permission
You can use this mod in any modpack as long as you don't reupload the mod. You can get a direct download link from modrinth.

### Other websites
This mod is only officially available on [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extended-drawers), [modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/extended-drawers) and [github](https://github.com/mattidragon/extendeddrawers). Any other sites are third-party reuploads and should not be trusted.

### Version support
I only support the latest and mostly modded version of minecraft. Old versions may receive important patches, but I will not be backporting the mod. 

*1.18 support has been abandoned. 1.19 will be the main focus now*

### Incompatibilities
I intend to try and stay compatible with as many mods as possible, but might abandon support for some if it becomes too hard.
* **Sodium** is only compatible if [indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is installed.
* **Optifine** will never be officially supported. Might work, might not.

credit me for the original (link is enough).
